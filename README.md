## What is living with them like?

*Are they helping in the household?*
- Only in a reverse sense.
- Leaving there hair all over the place.
- Do not clean their feet when entering the house.
- Do clean their plates very well.

*Do they pay rent?*
- Should have discussed that before letting them in.

*Will I kick them out?*
- **Excuse me?**
- Of course not!
- They have very inocent faces and are fluffy, which make up for many things.
